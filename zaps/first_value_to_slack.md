### Add User Properties

```
**User Email:** {{user_email}}
**Company:** {{company}}
**Role:** {{role}}
```

### Conditional Notifications
Add a filter step to only notify for certain conditions:
- Filter by `time_from_signup` < 30 (quick wins)
- Filter by `value_type` = "demo" (exclude test events)
- Filter by `source` = "landing" (only from your landing page)

### Different Channels
Create multiple Zaps for different audiences:
- `#sales` - for sales team to follow up
- `#product` - for product team insights
- `#founders` - for leadership updates

## Troubleshooting

### No Events Found
1. Check PostHog API key is correct
2. Verify event name matches exactly: `first_value`
3. Ensure events are being fired in PostHog
4. Try increasing time range to "Last 7 days"

### Missing Fields
1. Check that events include all required properties
2. Verify property names match exactly
3. Test with the `/seed.html` page to ensure consistent data

### Slack Connection Issues
1. Re-authenticate Slack connection
2. Check channel permissions
3. Verify bot is added to the channel

## Monitoring

### Check Zap Status
- Go to Zapier dashboard
- Look for failed runs
- Check error messages

### Test Regularly
- Use `/seed.html` to fire test events
- Verify Slack messages are received
- Check field mapping is correct

## Next Steps

1. Set up the "Stalled Users" Zap (see separate template)
2. Create a dashboard in Slack to track activation metrics
3. Add team reactions/celebrations to the channel
4. Consider adding to CRM for sales follow-up
