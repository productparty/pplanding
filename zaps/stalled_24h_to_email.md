# Zapier Template: Stalled Users â†’ Email Alert

## Overview
This Zap identifies users who started onboarding but haven't reached first value after 24 hours, then sends an email alert for follow-up.

## Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Create New Zap
1. Go to [zapier.com](https://zapier.com) and sign in
2. Click "Create Zap"
3. Name it: "Stalled Users â†’ Email Alert"

### Step 2: Choose Trigger
1. Search for "PostHog" in the trigger apps
2. Select "PostHog"
3. Choose trigger event: "New Event"
4. Connect your PostHog account:
   - API Key: `phc_3ACn7GrUe4Qzji0iXMvm7dmyL3XDx7G36SfUH9TQ4il`
   - Host: `https://us.i.posthog.com`
5. Configure trigger:
   - Event name: `onboarding_started`
   - Time range: "Last 24 hours"

### Step 3: Add Delay
1. Click "Add step" â†’ "Delay"
2. Choose "Delay by"
3. Set delay: 24 hours
4. This ensures we only alert after 24 hours have passed

### Step 4: Add Filter
1. Click "Add step" â†’ "Filter"
2. Set up filter to check if user has NOT fired `first_value`:
   - Field: `event_name`
   - Condition: "does not contain"
   - Value: `first_value`
3. This prevents alerts for users who already reached first value

### Step 5: Add Action
1. Click "Add action"
2. Search for "Gmail" or "Email by Zapier"
3. Select your preferred email service
4. Choose action: "Send Email"

### Step 6: Configure Email Action
1. Connect your email account
2. Configure email:

**To:** `your-team@company.com` (or specific team member)
**Subject:** `ðŸš¨ User stalled after 24h - {{user_id}}`
**Body:**
```

## Advanced Configuration

### Multiple Recipients
Set up different emails for different scenarios:
- `support@company.com` - for general support issues
- `sales@company.com` - for high-value prospects
- `founder@company.com` - for VIP users

### Conditional Logic
Add filters to only alert for certain conditions:
- Filter by `source` = "landing" (only from your landing page)
- Filter by `plan` = "pro" (only paid users)
- Filter by `step` = "payment" (only users stuck on payment)

### Escalation Rules
Create multiple Zaps for escalation:
1. **24h Zap** (this one) - First alert
2. **48h Zap** - Escalation to manager
3. **72h Zap** - Escalation to founder

## Troubleshooting

### No Events Found
1. Check PostHog API key is correct
2. Verify event name: `onboarding_started`
3. Ensure events are being fired
4. Check time range settings

### Delay Not Working
1. Verify delay is set to 24 hours
2. Check Zap timezone settings
3. Ensure Zap is published and active

### False Positives
1. Check filter logic is correct
2. Verify `first_value` events are being tracked
3. Test with `/seed.html` to ensure data consistency

### Email Delivery Issues
1. Check email service connection
2. Verify recipient email addresses
3. Check spam/junk folders
4. Test with a different email service

## Monitoring

### Check Zap Performance
- Go to Zapier dashboard
- Monitor success/failure rates

- Add more specific targeting

## Best Practices

### Response Time
- Set up auto-responders for immediate acknowledgment
- Establish SLA for manual follow-up (e.g., 2 hours)
- Track time from alert to resolution

### Personalization

- Reference specific onboarding step
- Add personalized help resources

### Documentation

## Next Steps

1. Set up the "First Value" Zap (see separate template)
2. Create a dashboard to track stalled user metrics
3. Develop intervention playbook for different stall scenarios
4. A/B test different follow-up approaches
